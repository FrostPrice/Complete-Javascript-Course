// Default Parameters

// Sometimes is usefull that Functions have Parameter that are set by default

const bookings = [];

// To set a default value on a Parameter simply put a = sign after the Parameter name and then the Value you want.
// A default Parameter is only used when there is no Value in the Argument section that would fill that Parameter

// You can use Expressions as a Default Parameter. Also you can use the Value from a Parameter defined before

// You cannot skip Parameters when passing an Argument
// To skip a Parameter and use its Default Parameter Value simply pass Undefined as an Argument to the Parameter you want to skip

///////////////////////////////////
// How Passing Arguments Works: Value vs. Reference

const flight = 'Lh234';
const jonas = {
  name: 'Jonas Schmedtman',
  passport: 24739479284,
};

const checkIn = function (flightNum, passenger) {
  flightNum = 'LH999';
  passenger.name = 'Mr. ' + passenger.name;

  if (passenger.passport === 24739479284) {
    alert('Check in');
  } else {
    alert('Wrong passaport!');
  }
};

// checkIn(flight, jonas);
// console.log(flight);
// console.log(jonas);

// Is the same as doing...
// const flightNum = flight;
// const passenger = jonas;

// When passing a Primitive type to a Parameter, a copy of that Value is made and the Function will use that copy instead of the original

// When a Reference Type is passed into a Parameter, a copy is not created but the Parameter is pointing to the same original Object, meaning tht if you change the Parameter Value in the Function it will also change the Original Value

// You should not change the Values of a Parameters in a Funtion

const newPassport = function (person) {
  person.passport = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 10000000000);
};

newPassport(jonas);
checkIn(flight, jonas);

// JavaScript doesn't have passing by Reference, it only has passing by Value

// Passing by Reference means that you are going to pass a reference to a Value and then when you change that reference you change the original Value too

///////////////////////////////////
// First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

// JavaScript has First-Class Functions, this means Functions are just Values, they are just another Type of Object, also they are treated as first-citizens

// You can store Functions in Variables and as Properties inside an Object

// You can also pass Functions as Arguments to other Functions

// You can return a Function from a Function

// There is also Methods that you can call on Functions

// A Higher Order Function is a Function that returns a new Funtion or recieve a Function as Argument, or both. You can only do this because of First-level Classes

// A Function inside a High-Order Function is called CallBack Function. It is called that because this CallBack Function will be called later by the High-Order Function

///////////////////////////////////
// Functions Accepting Callback Functions

const oneWord = function (str) {
  // return str.replaceAll(' ', '').toLowerCase();
  return str.replaceAll(/ /g, '').toLowerCase();
};

const upperFirstWord = function (str) {
  const [first, ...other] = str.split(' ');
  return [first.toUpperCase(), ...other].join(' ');
};

// Higher-order function
const transformer = function (str, fn) {
  console.log(`Original string: ${str}`);
  console.log(`Transformed string: ${fn(str)}`);

  console.log(`Transformed by: ${fn.name}`);
};

transformer('JavaScript is the best!', upperFirstWord);
transformer('JavaScript is the best!', oneWord);

// When passing a CallBack Function you don't put the (), because that would call the Function immediatelly, but without the () you are just making a reference to the Function and letting the Higher-Order Function Call the CallBack Function

// Functions have some Objects properties like the name property

// JS uses callbacks all the time
const high5 = function () {
  console.log('âœ‹');
};
document.body.addEventListener('click', high5);

['Jonas', 'Martha', 'Adam'].forEach(high5);

// CallBack Function are good to: make more reusable and interconnected parts, and to obstruct our code

// Obstruction means that you hide some part of your code because you don't need all that detail, allowing us to think in a more abstract way about our code problems

  return function (name) {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
  };
};

const greeterHey = greet('Hey'); // This Variable is a Function as return by the Function greet, and not a Value of the end execution of that Function, like a Primitive Value

// You can make a Function return other Function
greeterHey('Jonas');

// Challenge
const greetArr = greeting => name => console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);

// Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are Functions that are inly called once in the start of the application and it will never run again.

const booker = secureBooking();

booker();
booker();
booker();

console.dir(booker); // console.dir() shows a list of Properties in a Object. And it takes an Object (Function) as Argument
// You can see the Closure with console.dir()

// Each Execution Context in the Call Stack has a Varible Enviroment that contains all the local Variables

// Call Stack is the order in which Functions are called
// The Scope Chain is the order in which Function are writen in the code

// After a Function finishes executing, this Function is removed from the Call Stack

// A Closure makes a Function "remember" all the Variables that existed on the place that the Function was created. Even after the Execution Context, of the Function that was the Parent of the Function called ,is gone

// A Fuction always have access to the Variable Enviroment of the Execution Context in which the Function was created, this conection between the Function and the Variable Enviroment of the Execution Context in which this Function was created is called Closure

// Closure is basically the Variable Enviroent attached to the Fuction, exactly as it was at the time and place the Function was created

// JavaScript will look first for a Closure if a Value is not present in the Function itself. It will look first in the Closure even if a Variable with the same name is created in the Global Scope

// The Closure has priority over the Scope Chain

// Closure Summary:
// 1. A Closure is the closed-over Variable Enviroment of the Execution Context in which a Function was created, even after that Execution Context is gone
// 2. A Closure gives a Function access to all the Variables of its parent Function, even after that parent Function has returned. The Function keeps a reference to its outer Scope, which preserves the Scope Chain throughout the time
// 3. A Closure makes sure that a Function doesn't loose connection to Variables that existed at the Function's birth place
// 4. A Closure is like a backpack that a Function carries around whereever it goes. This backpack has all the Variables that were present in the encironment where the Function was created

// REMEMBER: A Closure is a feature and not something we do manually, JavaScript does this automatically, and we cannot access Closures explicity

///////////////////////////////////
// More Closure Examples

// Exemple 1
let f;

const g = function () {
  const a = 23;
  f = function () {
    console.log(a * 2);
  };
};

const h = function () {
  const b = 777;
  f = function () {
    console.log(b * 2);
  };
};

g();
f();
console.dir(f);

// Re-assigning f function
h();
f();
console.dir(f);

// You don't need to return a Function or define it inside a Parent Function to be able to "use" Closures

// If a Function is created in a Execution Context and then changed to another Execution Context, the Closure will be about the last Variable Environment it was "re-born" (Re-assigned)

// Exemple 2
const boardPassenger = function (n, wait) {
  const perGroup = n / 3;

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`We are now boarding all ${n} passengers`);
    console.log(`There are 3 groups, each with ${perGroup} passengers`);
  }, wait * 1000);

  console.log(`Will start boarding in ${wait} seconds`);
};

// The setTimeout() Function will run another Function (First Argument) based on a given time (Second Argument) that is usually in mileseconds

const perGroup = 1000; // A Closure has priority over the Scope Chain
boardPassenger(180, 3);

// A Closure includes Arguments passed in the Function

  const header = document.querySelector('h1');
  header.style.color = 'red';

  document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function () {

})();

// Answer: ALl this happen because of Closure
// By the time the Call Back Function in the Event Listener is called, the IIFE has already executed and the Execution Context of the IIFE is also gone. But even if the Variable Environment is gone the Call Back Function is still able to access the Variables in the Variable Environment that the Function was created
