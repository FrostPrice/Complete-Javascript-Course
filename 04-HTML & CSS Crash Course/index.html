<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Basic HTML Structure and Elements ! -->

<!-- index.html is the name of the main file in the project -->
<!-- HTML is used to describe the content of the page -->
<!-- HTML tags have a oppening tag and an ending tag -->

<!-- The Head is like the settings of the page -->

<!-- The Body is what's visible in the page  -->

<!-- VSCode create an entire HTML script by hitting ! -->

<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Attributes, Classes and IDs -->

<!-- Attributes describe elements(tags) -->
<!-- You can put elements inside one another -->
<!-- You can put elements inside one another -->
<!-- Inline elements are those that go alog with its parent element -->
<!-- Block elements are those that creates a new line or block for itself, not being in the same line as another element -->
<!-- You can put an image adress in the src of an image element -->
<!-- Classes and ids are used to name elements, to be used later on the CSS or by getting them with JavaScript -->
<!-- Classes can be used as many times as you want, but IDs have to be unique -->
<!-- It's a better practice to use more Classes than IDs -->
<!-- In CSS use - to separate words -->
<!-- A Form element is better to identify what's inside the box -->
<!-- Div is a generic box without meaning -->

<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Basic Styling with CSS -->

<!-- CSS styles the elements -->
<!-- You can select elements by Tag, by their Class names or Ids -->
<!-- CSS is created in a external file, not on the HTML -->
<!-- You need to link the HTML and the CSS, do that by using the Link element, and set the rel atribute to stylesheet -->
<!-- It's normal that some styles properties set in a parent element pass to the child element as well -->
<!-- To select Classes in the CSS file use . (Dot) and then the name of the Class. And with IDs is the same thing but with # (has) instead of the . (Dot) -->

<!-- ///////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<!-- Introduction to the CSS Box Model -->
<!-- Every element on a web page is set like a rectangular box. And in this box there is: a width, height, padding, margin and border -->
<!-- The Content is the text, image, etc. YOu can define the Content Height and Width -->
<!-- Padding is the transparent area around the Content, but inside the box -->
<!-- Border goes around the Padding and the Content -->
<!-- Margin is the space between boxes, it's outside the box -->
<!-- Fill area is an area that gets filled with a background property, it goes from the Content to the Border -->
<!-- It's good to reset all properties on CSS before starting to style them (Gobal Reset) -->
<!-- Use the * to select all elements on the page -->
<!-- The Box-Sizing propertie sets how the width and height is calculated -->
<!-- The Border_Box atribute sets tha padding and the border to be include in the height and width, meaning so that they will not be outside the width and height set -->
<!-- Some Properties can be set on only one side of an Element, like on the top, left, right, or bottom -->
<!-- You can select more than one Element per time, use , (comma) to select more Elements -->
<!-- Select a child Element by simply writing the name of the Child ELement after the Parent Element, without the , (comma) -->
<!-- By setting a height or width for an image, it will change the heigth and width proportionaly -->
